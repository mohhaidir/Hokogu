Hokogu is a web application helps people cook at home, eat at home, and stay at home, in the current era of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our application is designed to help users find food recipes and guide them through the home-cooking process. With the help of voice recognition technology, Hogoku allows the users to navigate the application without touching the device.
